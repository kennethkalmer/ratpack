== DESCRIPTION:

Ratpack is a small Sinatra-based HTTP to XMPP bridge, allowing you to send
jabber messages in a RESTful fashion. Messages can be sent to a pool of contacts
in broadcast or round-robin mode, or individually.

I'm aware of BOSH[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOSH], but I'm not sure if this
will compete against it since BOSH should be for publicly accessible resource
that need to scale (It is can XEP by the way).

Ratpack is meant to be used where XMPP forms part of the backend processing
environments, like bots that perform rankings or crawl sites or whatever
impractical use you can think of :)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Send messages asynchronously to individual contacts
* Send messages asynchronously to groups of contacts (broadcast & round-robin)
* Send messages synchronously to individual contacts, blocking for response
* Read incoming messages

* Performance is slow, expected for POC

== TODO:

* Speed this baby up, gonna need some help here

== SYNOPSIS:

  GET /
  POST /message with to & message where to is valid JID
  POST /broadcast with recipients[] & message where recipientsp[] valid JID's
  POST /pool with pool & message where pool is in config/pools.yml

Here are some examples with curl

  $ curl -F to=kenneth@devbox -F message=test http://localhost:4567/message
  $ curl -F recipients[]=kenneth@devbox -F recipients[]=kenneth@devbox -F message=test3 http://localhost:4567/broadcast
  $ curl -F pool=sample -F message=test_pool http://localhost:4567/pool

== REQUIREMENTS:

* sinatra (0.3.3)
* xmpp4r-simple (0.8.8)
