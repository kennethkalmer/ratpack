* http://github.com/kennethkalmer/ratpack

== DESCRIPTION:

Ratpack is a small Sinatra-based HTTP to XMPP/AMQP bridge, allowing you to send
messages in a RESTful fashion. XMPP messages can be sent to a pool of contacts
in broadcast or round-robin mode, or individually. AMQP messages are sent into
the queue of choice.

I'm aware of BOSH[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOSH], but I'm not sure if this
will compete against it since BOSH should be for publicly accessible resource
that need to scale (It is an XEP by the way). For AMQP there a fuller 
implementation called RestMS[http://www.restms.org].

Ratpack is meant to be used where XMPP/AMQP forms part of the backend processing
environments, like bots that perform rankings or crawl sites or whatever
impractical use you can think of :)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

XMPP

* Send messages asynchronously to individual contacts
* Send messages asynchronously to groups of contacts (broadcast & round-robin)
* Send messages synchronously to individual contacts, blocking for response
* Read incoming messages [Eventually]

AMQP

* Send messages asynchronously to named queues

* Performance is slow, expected for POC

== TODO:

* Switch to rack-mount
* Implement loudmouth-ruby for XMPP
* Speed this baby up, gonna need some help here

== SYNOPSIS:

  GET /
  POST /xmpp/message with to & message where to is valid JID
  POST /xmpp/broadcast with recipients[] & message where recipientsp[] valid JID's
  POST /xmpp/pool with pool & message where pool is in config/pools.yml
  POST /amqp/[queue] where queue is the name of the queue to send to and message is the message

Here are some examples with curl

  $ curl -F to=kenneth@devbox -F message=test http://localhost:4567/xmpp/message
  $ curl -F recipients[]=kenneth@devbox -F recipients[]=kenneth@devbox -F message=test3 http://localhost:4567/xmpp/broadcast
  $ curl -F pool=sample -F message=test_pool http://localhost:4567/xmpp/pool
  $ curl -F message=test http://localhost:4567/amqp/queue

== REQUIREMENTS:

* sinatra (0.9.1.1)
* xmpp4r-simple (0.8.8)
* amqp (0.6.0)
